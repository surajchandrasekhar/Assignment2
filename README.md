##Assignment 2

This project was about introducing ourselves to R programming.

1. For this project, I used Google and the learning modules to complete the assignment.
2. The assignment approximately 2 hours to fully complete
3. This homework was approximately a 4 in difficulty as for some parts, you had to spend a good amount of time finding the proper syntax.
4. For this assignment, make sure the students know that they must have the newest version of R and RStudio because I did not since I had used this software for a class last year, and I couldn't install the stringr package because of that.
